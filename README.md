## Google Drive 
All project shared documents are in an [Automation Collaboration Google Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hggvLtU0dFwGboIcLOrIEFHBn5Ge7P1t). Within this folder is the following subfolder structure:

- [**Application Development**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LR0K-ulqP3_U6ZDkN2sHWr80sR0lMXUA) folder includes all working documents pertaining to the online web tool design and data flow.
- [**Automation Documentation**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Z_cNm_T9tNY3yQgzH51AsU0ldLdlY49x) folder is shared with SEFSC data analysts. This folder is meant to house all final metadata documents, resources, and briefing presentations.
- [**Misc**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AnoO5cFGZRXE3Ya4rPuzXReQFKrC9l6P) folder contains legacy or miscellaneous documents created from previous CIMAS employees.
- [**Proposals/Funding**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-AEQx3weWPvACsFDwuSL0Whn1fS9MvL9) folder contains the FIS proposal as well as notes on the justification of the project.
- [**QA/QC Views**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eTXt5hye1po_JgR0wEmaqqMMdo1GTgTb) folder is meant to include all working/draft materials in creating cleaned views built from the Standard Views. The main difference between a QA/QC view and standard view of the same dataset is the use of flags to remove questionable data and identify outliers. A QA/QC view is being developed from the TIP data first.
- [**Standard Views**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TWkLqW__SzFi8wuvOvVY-PApyCobtcvX) folder is meant to include all working/draft materials in creating a standard data extraction for each of the commercial collection programs. Similar fields across programs are standardized and common variable naming conventions are applied to all views. This folder also contains a [Translation](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OKmlm5p3T4-DpYOgU9iOWSABsfKimUC3) folder for building and reconciling cross reference tables used in the standard views. Areas translation tables were built by the Automation Team while species, gear, and county tables were reconciled by the Autoamtion Team from several sources.
- The team has a biweekly meeting with NOAA advisors (Dave Gloeckner and Alan Lowther) to discuss project updates and questions. [**Meeting Notes**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TuWp4VnOJq_GlB1ibX6T2llZbDEDCGbD1qxzw65Mb0k/edit#) started in 2022.
