# Project Planning for FIS Automation Project

The Fisheries Statistics Division (FSD) of the SEFSC provides fishery data to a number of regional and national partners, NMFS offices, and stock assessment analysts each year. The SEFSC is currently undergoing a multi-year effort to increase the throughput of data required for stock assessments through the standardization of data inputs and the timeliness by which they are accessed. Processing the data for stock assessments or management is often time-consuming and produced individualistically. Standardizing and automating the compilation and delivery of data to assessment scientists and resource managers will remove inconsistencies, reduce excess processing and create highly repeatable, standard datasets for a multitude of uses. 

To date, this project has successfully completed the development of many commercial fishery-dependent standardized data extractions and ancillary data products such as translation tables to automate data delivery. Our work will develop a user-friendly, secure web application that will allow analysts and managers to generate and access data in a timely and consistent manner. A repository component will increase transparency and allow users to regenerate past queried parameters to promote continuity and reproducibility.

**Current Team Members:** Sarina Atkinson, Sydney Alhale, Sandra Aguilar (CIMAS)

**Past Team Members:** Allison Shideler, Brett Pierce, Alex Smith (CIMAS)

Project initially started in 2018.

2021 approved funding through FIS for FY22.

## Google Drive 
All project shared documents are in an [Automation Collaboration Google Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hggvLtU0dFwGboIcLOrIEFHBn5Ge7P1t). Within this folder is the following subfolder structure:

- [**Application Development**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LR0K-ulqP3_U6ZDkN2sHWr80sR0lMXUA) folder includes all working documents pertaining to the online web tool design and data flow.
- [**Automation Documentation**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Z_cNm_T9tNY3yQgzH51AsU0ldLdlY49x) folder is shared with SEFSC data analysts. This folder is meant to house all final metadata documents, resources, and briefing presentations.
- [**Misc**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AnoO5cFGZRXE3Ya4rPuzXReQFKrC9l6P) folder contains legacy or miscellaneous documents created from previous CIMAS employees.
- [**Proposals/Funding**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-AEQx3weWPvACsFDwuSL0Whn1fS9MvL9) folder contains the FIS proposal as well as notes on the justification of the project.
- [**QA/QC Views**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eTXt5hye1po_JgR0wEmaqqMMdo1GTgTb) folder is meant to include all working/draft materials in creating cleaned views built from the Standard Views. The main difference between a QA/QC view and standard view of the same dataset is the use of flags to remove questionable data and identify outliers. A QA/QC view is being developed from the TIP data first.
- [**Standard Views**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TWkLqW__SzFi8wuvOvVY-PApyCobtcvX) folder is meant to include all working/draft materials in creating a standard data extraction for each of the commercial collection programs. Similar fields across programs are standardized and common variable naming conventions are applied to all views. This folder also contains a [Translation](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OKmlm5p3T4-DpYOgU9iOWSABsfKimUC3) folder for building and reconciling cross reference tables used in the standard views. Areas translation tables were built by the Automation Team while species, gear, and county tables were reconciled by the Autoamtion Team from several sources.
- The team has a biweekly meeting with NOAA advisors (Dave Gloeckner and Alan Lowther) to discuss project updates and questions. [**Meeting Notes**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TuWp4VnOJq_GlB1ibX6T2llZbDEDCGbD1qxzw65Mb0k/edit#) started in 2022.
